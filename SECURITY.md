# Security Policy

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow the instructions below to report it responsibly.

## Scope

This policy applies to vulnerabilities in the Moodle Design System codebase and its dependencies. Issues related to third-party services, social engineering, or denial-of-service attacks are out of scope.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security issues by creating an issue at [Moodle Design System tracker](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDS).

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The impact and potential risk
- Affected versions or components
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code

We aim to acknowledge your report within 3 business days and provide a resolution within 30 days. We may request additional information to help us resolve the issue.

## Timeline

1. **Triage:** We review and validate the report.
2. **Investigation:** We assess the impact and determine a fix.
3. **Resolution:** We implement and test the fix.
4. **Disclosure:** We coordinate public disclosure with the reporter, if appropriate.

Duplicate or low-severity issues may be closed with an explanation.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the latest major version. Older versions may not receive security fixes.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow the principle of [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure). We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.

## Credit

We appreciate responsible reporters and, with your permission, will credit you in our release notes. If you wish to remain anonymous, please let us know.

## Privacy

All vulnerability reports are handled confidentially. We will not share your information outside the security response team without your consent.

## Legal

We will not pursue legal action against individuals who report vulnerabilities in good faith and follow this policy.

## Security Tools

We use automated tools (e.g., Dependabot) to monitor our dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## Policy Updates

This policy may be updated from time to time. Please refer to the repository for the latest version.

Thank you for helping keep our project and community safe.
